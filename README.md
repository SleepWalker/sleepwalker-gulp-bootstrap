This is another one bootstrap package, that contains all `gulp` tasks I use, while developing frontend applications:

* watch
* sass and compass
* imagemin
* fonts (simple task to copy fonts from src to dist)
* browserify
* browserify-handlebars
* browsersync
* mocha, chai, sinon
* mocha-browserify (for bundling tests)
* mocha-phantomjs (for running tests in headles browser)

In `copy-to-root` dir you'll wind some useful files for package managers,  preprocessors, test runners

Command for installing
`npm install sleepwalker-gulp-bootstrap --save-dev`
